# Team 18's notes for Authorization.

Based on the requirements, I think Basic Auth is probably going to be sufficient.  We know we will have to make updates and do an integration with StateFarms internal AD for authentication if they go to onboard this app.  So burning through the additional cycles beyond basic auth is probably not required.  We can add a stretch goal to dig standup an LDAP server and integrate authentication with that to make the transition from Heroku to SF easier, but I do not think that should be a priority task.

- **Basic Auth:**  Requires sign in with username/ID and password.
		â—‹ Typically takes the password and compares it to that which is stored in the authentication database.

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|PROS:   |Easy to manage in app   |Easy to deploy   |Easy for end users   | 
|CONS:   |Pws weakly specified   |IDs can be spoofed  |PWs susceptible to theft |

- **Multi-Factor Auth:** combination of auth to validate ID
	- Typically uses name and password, paired with some form of token
	  -  Token could be smart-card, one-time passphrase, single use PINS, biometric info

|   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|PROS:  |Difficult to spoof   |Easy to use   |   |   |
|CONS:   |Deploy difficult   |Tokens easy to steal   |Mgmt of tokens challenging, esp if token is lost/stolen	 |

- **Cryptographic Auth:**  includes public key auth, digital signature, message auth code, password permutation
  -  This looks out of scope for what we are capable of doing, unless we use 3rd party auth service.

- **API Key:** This is a generated code given to the developer that is a long, unguessable string
  - Can pass alongside auth header:
    - curl "https://example.com/" \
    - -H "Authorization: 234092oasdfn320dafn3252304fd"

|   |   | 
|---|---|
|PROS:  |Add nuance to given keys: restricts some, gives access to others |
|CONS:   |No standard on API key like that of basic authentication (standards were est in 1999) |

- **OAuth:** Ensures end user shared no creds with third-party appl, ie, the developer.

|   |   |   | 
|---|---|---|
|PROS:  |Can handle sign in through common apps: github, fb, apple, twitter, google, microsoft, yahoo |promotes best practices|
|CONS:   |Tricky for new devs to impl |  No one-way of doing OAuth |

- **Firebase Auth:** 3rd party service that has open-source JS library for web auth solutions 

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|PROS:  |Can handle sign in through common apps: github, fb, apple, twitter, google, microsoft, yahoo| promotes best practices |
|   |Has drop-in auth or manual SDK impl   |Has framework for web, mobile and Unity   |   |
|CONS:   |Exports service to Google for Auth|   |   |
