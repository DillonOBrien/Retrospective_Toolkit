Researching on unique ID generation JS solution for node.js server. 

Researched that I concluded is to ensure that NPM package is installed 

var uuid = require('node-uuid');

var timeBasedID = uuid.v1(); // -> '85032cjlk3n'

var randomID = uuid.v4(); // -> '34525mkjn5lc'

var url = 'www.retrospectivetoolkit.com' + randomID;  

Even looked into research ShortId and NanoID
