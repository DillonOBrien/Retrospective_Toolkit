Network Diagram. Design will be updated along the way and to made more scalable. Although DNS is chosen since we are hosting form the cloud it is shown but may change to IP.

Network flow diagram updated.  Design needed to be able to scale.  Designed a forward looking architecture to accomodate a scaling design.  For the project we will implement a scaled down version, but having the design in place will ensure that we do not introduce any one way doors that would prevent this for succeeding as it scales.

A couple of other things to consider and make decisions on

    * Will we use IP or DNS to connec to the site?
    ** Probably need to use DNS because we are hosting in the cloud.  So we need to investigate if Heroku will provide a stable dynamic DNS name for us to use as the landing page.
    ***Update from heroku
        > By default, a Heroku app is available at its Heroku domain, which has the form [name of app].herokuapp.com. For example, an app named serene-example-4269 is hosted at serene-example-4269.herokuapp.com.> 

Network Connectivity Diagram Created and Updated

- Potential network flow must be maintainable and scale.
   -  Heroku service for app hosting and database (Postgres, included, but can use other database if necessary).
      -  Heroku can scale app automatically as needed.  Can be adjusted in configuration of app service on website.  
         -  assuming we build it correctly.
   -  potential high-level design:
