- **React JS:**  Use Node/React for frontend web application
  -  React-Router can be used for page routes client-side.
  -  React has extensive libraries that could be utilized to make dev easier
  -  Will need async controllers to communicate with Java backend.
      - found initial setup getting comms with java to be tough (mostly due to my lack of experience with async and Java Spring)
