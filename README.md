### Introduction

This Retrospective Toolkit (the "Toolkit") is the product of Team 18's capstone project.  The toolkit will be used as a training tool by our sponsor and will contain two base activities: a cube activity and a model-building activity.

The functional aspects of the Toolkit are separated into three areas: (1) frontend components, (2) backend components, and (3) cloud-hosting and database components.  This document will cover the topics and technology used in the project.
