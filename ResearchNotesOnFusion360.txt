Currently our table model is without a surface texture in our fusion 360 environment. This research took about two hours to first learn fusion 360 and then use the autodesk meshmixer to apply surface texture to my 3d prints. Currently we are trying to attach woodlike texture and other textures to the table model. This also involves inscribing the logo. I learned to apply textures we can use the make command to genearte a mesh for the object. From here we can the n import the model directly into the auto desk mesh mixer if we are using the meshmixer as the print utility. Using sculpt we can then apply the texture to the 3d object.
