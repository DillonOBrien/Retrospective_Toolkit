Reviewing authorization errors 

Reviewing over structs and routes for the authenticators being middleware. 

let protected = app.grouped(UserAuthenticator())
protected.get("me") { req -> String in
    try req.auth.require(User.self).name
}

Even testing out alterative such as bearer authentication such as 
Bearer foo. 

Error is client dependent and resolved.
