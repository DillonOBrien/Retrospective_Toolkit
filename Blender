Investiagtion into using blender was an interesting task since none of us have previous experience with 3d modeling. Blender is a free and open source 3d 
computer graphics tool that will interact with Unity to import 3d models into the game. The main person of using blender is to create a cup and to create a die. 
These die will then be reproduced to feature different images on the side of the die. Blender is free to those who are using it for personal non monetized products along 
with unity since we are not monetizing our product and we are not making more than 100k.
