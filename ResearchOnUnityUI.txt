Study Unity UI

In order to get the dice to roll and create a functional game. It is important to study how unity UI works. 

I have spent 2 hours researching unity UI and how it works along with making it function with the scripts. 
Tasks that need to be handled by unity UI is 

Menuscene
Roll Button
Display Images that die roll on. 

I learned to make a UI
- select game object -> ui -> image 
- set x y and z position 
image displays sprite
canvas is root object of all UI elements
event system handles input events

I need to create an image background for the menu. 

I need to utilize the canvas scaler to ensure ui elements retain same pixel size. 

Nead to add header image 
- select image in the hierarchy
- create source image
- set native size

need to anchor position down.

create button labeled as credits that shows credits then returns to menu scene.
