The goal is to get a sound or short audio file to play on our react application. 

We are to use HTML code such as <audio> inside render() functions to embed the sound content. Inside the mp3 file is saved as src. 
getElementsByClassName() grabs the element and audioEl.play() plays the element. We are to use <button> and an onClick() method that will play when the dice are rolled playing the audioEl.play()
