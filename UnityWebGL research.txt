Research on Unity to web integration 

Today was spent studying WebGL and interacting with browser scripting to get the unity game to work with web browsers.
Here are summarizations points 
	- Unity does not provide functionality for WEB API
	- Utilize WebGL 
	- Cannot directly interface with javascript engine on browser
	- Utilize .jslib extension in plugins subfolder in unity assets
	-Ensure it has proper syntax 
		-Refer to docs.unity3d for this
	- Call functions using dll import
		-DllImport("__Internal")]
	- Call unity script functions from java script such as object name, methodname and value
		-unityInstance.SendMessage('MyGameObject', 'MyFunction');
	- build code is executed in its own scope
	- prevents conflicts with embedding code.
	- Do not call the internal javascript functions if you are able to.
